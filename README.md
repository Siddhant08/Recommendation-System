# Recommendation-System
The recommendation system predicts what rating a user would give to a movie based on the user's reviews of other movies. The prediction model uses linear regression for prediction and gradient descent for error minimization. Each movie has a score of the feature sets defined on it and a corresponding rating given to it by a user. The final output is a list of predicted ratings and based on that, the system recommends the most highly rated movie to the user.
Libraries included are numpy, scipy.
This is basically a personalized tool specific to each user considering a user's preferences. Contact me if you can suggest changes or figure out ways to improve it.
